# Booking Project (Test Case)
![Design Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cagataykula/case-hotel-booking/master/src/assets/images/introduction/full-pages.png)

This project made as a test case for companies by me. I used vuex and local storage. It's a little bit dirty coded but I'll fix it when I have free time.

## Home Page
This page is the date selection page. I add validations here. Also user cant select from yesterday as a check-in date.

## Spec Page
This page is made to choose room specs. It also has validation. Both fields are required.


## Payment Page
This is my favorite. Because I made the credit card animation and it can be flip over. Just drag your cursor to the credit card or click the CVV/CVC input, you'll see. When I have free time I'll make it a library for open source.

## Steps

This part is also my favorite. Because it's controlling by a top component. It's clickable and sticky of the div. You can see the example. Also, there is a progress bar. 


## Credit Card

It has a card type detector. The card type logo can be change according to your credit card type. Right now Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Troy, and Union Pay available. I also will make this a library.
